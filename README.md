# Flow Track

[中文文档](README_CN.md)

Flow Track is a lightweight, high-precision desktop automation utility. It empowers users to preset a sequence of click and text-pasting tasks at exact timestamps, freeing your hands from repetitive manual operations.

- **Premium UI**: "Flow Track" Cyber-Green geek design with Glassmorphism, tailored for a fluid and high-tech user experience.
- **Full Tooltip Support**: Every icon and input field is equipped with bilingual hover-over explanations, significantly lowering the learning curve.
- **Precise Scheduling**: Uses high-fidelity 3-spinbox time inputs (HH:MM:SS) for intuitive and accurate scheduling.
- **Text Pasting**: Supports pasting multi-line text with an independent pop-up text editor, preserving formatting and indentation.
- **Integrated Logging**: Real-time activity logs presented in a cohesive glassmorphic card for instant feedback.
- **Auto-Countdown Exit**: Optional feature. Once all scheduled tasks complete, the app enters a 10s countdown and closes securely.
- **Window Memory**: Automatically remembers and restores window position and size from the previous session.
- **Bilingual Support**: Instant switching between **English** and **Chinese** with high-fidelity translations.
- **Portable & Persistent**: Single EXE distribution that saves user-specific settings to `config/config.ini`.
- **High Stability**: Robust ARGB rendering and event-interception logic prevent glitches and accidental input changes.

## 🏗️ Architecture

Flow Track follows a modular **separation of concerns** design to ensure maintainability and high performance:

- **Core Engine**: Encapsulates automation logic, configuration management, and localized i18n support.
- **Worker Threading**: Utilizes `QThread` to handle background mouse monitoring and movement, ensuring a lag-free UI experience.
- **Glassmorphic UI Layer**: A modern interface built with PySide6, featuring custom styled widgets with real-time ARGB rendering and shadow effects.
